// ============================================
// GraphView - D3.js Force-Directed Graph
// ============================================
// Note: This is a large module that handles the interactive graph visualization
// It's kept separate due to its complexity and D3.js dependencies

// This file will be loaded as a module but contains the full GraphView class
// from the original app.js (lines ~1000-2200)

// For now, this is a placeholder that will be populated with the graph view code
// The graph view code is complex and should remain as a single cohesive unit

export default null; // Placeholder - will be replaced with actual GraphView class
